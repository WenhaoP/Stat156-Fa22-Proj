The outcome of interest is the intensity and frequency of civil conflicts in Sub-saharan Africa between the year 1981 and 1999. The data comes from Armed Conflict Dataset published joinly by Peace Research Institute, Oslo (PRIO) and Department of Peace and Conflict Research, Uppsala University. is the main data 

The Armed Conflict Dataset is the main data source for understanding civil conflicts, the outcome of interest. Unfortunately, since the study was published in 2004, there has been numerous updates to the dataset and the verison that the authors used in the paper are not longer available on the internet. We used the oldest verison of the dataset that we could find (Verison3, published in 2005). Another big challenge we faced is that the authors used the "monadic" verison of the dataset, a derived verison of the main Armed Conflict Dataset. By "monadic" we refer to a data structure where a country is the main unit of analysis with one row for each **country** each year. However, the raw Armed Conflict Dataset uses one row for each **conflict** each year. To our disappointment, the International Peace Research Institute, Oslo (PRIO) stopped publishing the "monadic" verison of the dataset. Therefore, we have to use the Armed Conflict Dataset to regenerate the "monadic" verison of the dataset on our own. The following summary table compares the dataset we used and the dataset that the authors used. 

The dataset we used has less overall conflicts and wars compared with the authors', notably for South Africa. Investigating carefully, we found out some conflicts has been removed from Version 2.1 to Version 3.0 of the dataset, and the conflicts at South Africa from 1989 to 1993 were removed without explainations (page 121, UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset's Version History and Known Errata, version 22.1). Similarly, two conflicts have been removed for Niger and one conflict have been removed for Liberia and Burundi, respectively.    Those changes led to a reduction of the overall conflicts and wars in our dataset compared to the authors'. In sebseqent analysis, we will see that the removal of those data points have a substential impact on the estimated relationship between economic growth and armed conflict in Africa.  

================
Replicate the main results

The authors used **linear instrumental variable model** to identify the casual effect of economic growth on the intensity and frequency of civil conflicts in Sub-saharan Africa between the year 1981 and 1999. There are two critical assumptions for the identification of causal effect using linear IV model:
- First, we need relevance. Rainfall (the instrument) needs to be sufficiently correlated with the economic growth (treatment) in Sub-saharan Africa. Mathmatically, it's cov(Z, D) != 0. 
- Second, we need **exclusion restriction**: difference in rainfall needs to affacts civil conflict only through economic growth, conditional on all covariants.  Mathmatically, it's E(Z\epslion |X) = 0[^latex]. 


Critical appraisal of causal identification assumption: 

The first assumption can be tested using the data. We replicated Table 2 of the original paper, which shows that rainfall is indeed related to economic growth[^insert table 2?]. However, the rainfall instruments are weak  (the F-statistic is 4.0 in regression 3 in table 2). The authors also acknowledged that the instrument is not strongly correlated with the treatment, but they proceeded to use 2SLS (two staged least squares) to estimate the causal effect.   
A weak instrument poses a potential threat to the assotytic normality assumption, which is required for the 2SLS confidence level to be valid. Using clustered robust standard errors does not account for this problem. Therefore, as an additional robustness check, we used the Fieller-Anderson-Rubin test (The "inversion" Test) to contruct confidence intervals robust to weak IV, and compared them with the original 2SLS confidence level given by the authors. The details will be in the re-analysis section. 

The second assumption can only be tested partily through data. Regression 2 in Table 2 aims to test the correlation between observed covariants and rainfall (the instrument). We successfully replicated the authors' result and showed that the observed covariants are indeed uncorrelated with the instrument. However, there could be unobserved covariants that are correlated with the instrument. For example, rainfall could influence civil conflict via the pathway of income inequality or rural poverty rates instead of per capita economic growth, as the authors acknowledged. To address this issue, we will analyze the data using an alternative approach, without using the instrumental variable method. Details will be showed in the re-analysis section. 

Robustness check: 

 We successfully replicated the “false experiment” speciﬁcation that the authors attemped, in which future rainfall growth is used as an additional explanatory variable in the regression. We checked the coefﬁcient estimate for rainfall is near zero (coefﬁcient estimate -0.007, standard error 0.016, in regression 4 of table 2). The purpose of this robustness check is to test if rainfall is a valid instrument by including a "future" variable that is supposed to be uncorrelated with the treatment. 
 
 Additionally, we replicated dropping one country at a time for the IV-2SLS ﬁxed-effects results for the 25-death threshold. The purpose of this robustness check is to test if the relationship between economic growth and civil conflict remain stable if one country is an outlier (i.e. check if there is a country that has substentially more conflicts than others, which could exagerate the negative impact of economic shocks on civil conflict). We found that it's indeed robust with coefﬁcients on lagged economic growth ranging from 2.0 to 1 and remaining signiﬁcant at 90 percent conﬁdence levels in all regressions[^TODO].
