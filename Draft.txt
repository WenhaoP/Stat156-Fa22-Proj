The outcome of interest is the intensity and frequency of civil conflicts in Sub-saharan Africa between the year 1981 and 1999. The data comes from Armed Conflict Dataset published joinly by Peace Research Institute, Oslo (PRIO) and Department of Peace and Conflict Research, Uppsala University. is the main data 

The Armed Conflict Dataset is the main data source for understanding civil conflicts, the outcome of interest. Unfortunately, since the study was published in 2004, there has been numerous updates to the dataset and the verison that the authors used in the paper are not longer available on the internet. We used the oldest verison of the dataset that we could find (Verison3, published in 2005). Another big challenge we faced is that the authors used the "monadic" verison of the dataset, a derived verison of the main Armed Conflict Dataset. By "monadic" we refer to a data structure where a country is the main unit of analysis with one row for each **country** each year. However, the raw Armed Conflict Dataset uses one row for each **conflict** each year. To our disappointment, the International Peace Research Institute, Oslo (PRIO) stopped publishing the "monadic" verison of the dataset. Therefore, we have to use the Armed Conflict Dataset to regenerate the "monadic" verison of the dataset on our own. The following summary table compares the dataset we used and the dataset that the authors used. 

The dataset we used has less overall conflicts and wars compared with the authors', notably for South Africa. Investigating carefully, we found out some conflicts has been removed from Version 2.1 to Version 3.0 of the dataset, and the conflicts at South Africa from 1989 to 1993 were removed without explainations (page 121, UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset's Version History and Known Errata, version 22.1). Similarly, two conflicts have been removed for Niger and one conflict have been removed for Liberia and Burundi, respectively.    Those changes led to a reduction of the overall conflicts and wars in our dataset compared to the authors'. In sebseqent analysis, we will see that the removal of those data points have a substential impact on the estimated relationship between economic growth and armed conflict in Africa.  

What's next: describe table 4 and table 5.

Working in progress: Replicate the main results


1. Describe the empirical method in identifying the causal effect (for instance, whether the researchers conduct a randomized experiment or use policy changes to answer their research questions) and state their assumptions for identifying the causal effect clearly in both English and mathematics;
2. Replicate the main result of the paper and interpret it in English;
3. Critically appraise the stated assumptions for causal identification.

The authors used **linear instrumental variable model** to identify the casual effect of economic growth on the intensity and frequency of civil conflicts in Sub-saharan Africa between the year 1981 and 1999. There are two critical assumptions for the identification of causal effect using linear IV model:
- First, we need relevance. Rainfall (the instrument) needs to be sufficiently correlated with the economic growth (treatment) in Sub-saharan Africa. Mathmatically, it's cov(Z, D) != 0. 
- Second, we need **exclusion restriction**: difference in rainfall needs to affacts civil conflict only through economic growth, conditional on all covariants.  Mathmatically, it's E(Z\epslion |X) = 0[^latex]. 




Critical appraisal of causal identification assumption: 

The first assumption can be tested using the data. We replicated Table 2 of the original paper, which shows that rainfall is indeed related to economic growth[^insert table 2?]. However, the rainfall instruments are weak  (the F-statistic is 4.0 in regression 3 in table 2). The authors also acknowledged that the instrument is not strongly correlated with the treatment, but they proceeded to use 2SLS (two staged least squares) to estimate the causal effect. A weak instrument poses a potential threat to the assotytic normality assumption required for the validity of 2SLS confidence level, even if clustered robust standard errors are used. Therefore, as an additional robustness check, we used the Fieller-Anderson-Rubin test (The "inversion" Test) to contruct confidence intervals robust to weak IV, and compared them with the original 2SLS confidence level given by the authors. The details will be in the re-analysis section. 

The second assumption can only be tested partily through the data. We replicated regression 2 , 4 in Table 2.

Robustness check: 
- As an identiﬁcation check, we estimate a “false experiment” speciﬁcation in which future rainfall growth—which should be orthogonal to current economic growth, conditional on countryspeciﬁc time trends—is included as an additional explanatory variable. and we ﬁnd that the coefﬁcient estimate is indeed near zero (coefﬁcient estimate 0.001, standard error 0.019, in regression 4 of table 2). 
- robustness checks and explore different dependent variables. The IV-2SLS ﬁxed-effects results for the 25-death threshold are robust to dropping one country at a time, with coefﬁcients on lagged economic growth ranging from 2.9 to 1.9 and remaining signiﬁcant at 94 percent conﬁdence levels in all regressions.
