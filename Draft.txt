The outcome of interest is the intensity and frequency of civil conflicts in Sub-saharan Africa between the year 1981 and 1999. The data comes from Armed Conflict Dataset published joinly by Peace Research Institute, Oslo (PRIO) and Department of Peace and Conflict Research, Uppsala University. is the main data 

The Armed Conflict Dataset is the main data source for understanding civil conflicts, the outcome of interest. Unfortunately, since the study was published in 2004, there has been numerous updates to the dataset and the verison that the authors used in the paper are not longer available on the internet. We used the oldest verison of the dataset that we could find (Verison3, published in 2005). Another big challenge we faced is that the authors used the "monadic" verison of the dataset, a derived verison of the main Armed Conflict Dataset. By "monadic" we refer to a data structure where a country is the main unit of analysis with one row for each **country** each year. However, the raw Armed Conflict Dataset uses one row for each **conflict** each year. To our disappointment, the International Peace Research Institute, Oslo (PRIO) stopped publishing the "monadic" verison of the dataset. Therefore, we have to use the Armed Conflict Dataset to regenerate the "monadic" verison of the dataset on our own. The following summary table compares the dataset we used and the dataset that the authors used. 

The dataset we used has less overall conflicts and wars compared with the authors', notably for South Africa. Investigating carefully, we found out some conflicts has been removed from Version 2.1 to Version 3.0 of the dataset, and the conflicts at South Africa from 1989 to 1993 were removed without explainations [^page 121, UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset's Version History and Known Errata, version 22.1]. Similarly, two conflicts have been removed for Niger and one conflict have been removed for Liberia and Burundi, respectively.    Those changes led to a reduction of the overall conflicts and wars in our dataset compared to the authors'. In sebseqent analysis, we will see that the removal of those data points have a substential impact on the estimated relationship between economic growth and armed conflict in Africa.  

================
Replicate the main results

The authors used **linear instrumental variable model** to identify the casual effect of economic growth on the intensity and frequency of civil conflicts in Sub-saharan Africa between the year 1981 and 1999. There are two critical assumptions for the identification of causal effect using linear IV model:
- First, we need relevance. Rainfall (the instrument) needs to be sufficiently correlated with the economic growth (treatment) in Sub-saharan Africa. Mathmatically, it's cov(Z, D) != 0. 
- Second, we need **exclusion restriction**: difference in rainfall needs to affacts civil conflict only through economic growth, conditional on all covariants.  Mathmatically, it's E(Z\epslion |X) = 0[^latex]. 


Critical appraisal of causal identification assumption: 

The first assumption can be tested using the data. We replicated Table 2 of the original paper, which shows that rainfall is indeed related to economic growth[^insert table 2?]. However, the rainfall instruments are weak  (the F-statistic is 4.0 in regression 3 in table 2). The authors also acknowledged that the instrument is not strongly correlated with the treatment, but they proceeded to use 2SLS (two staged least squares) to estimate the causal effect.   
A weak instrument poses a potential threat to the assotytic normality assumption, which is required for the 2SLS confidence level to be valid. Using clustered robust standard errors does not account for this problem. Therefore, as an additional robustness check, we used the Fieller-Anderson-Rubin test (The "inversion" Test) to contruct confidence intervals robust to weak IV, and compared them with the original 2SLS confidence level given by the authors. The details will be in the re-analysis section. 

The second assumption can only be tested partily through data. Regression 2 in Table 2 aims to test the correlation between observed covariants and rainfall (the instrument). We successfully replicated the authors' result and showed that the observed covariants are indeed uncorrelated with the instrument. However, there could be unobserved covariants that are correlated with the instrument. For example, rainfall could influence civil conflict via the pathway of income inequality or rural poverty rates instead of per capita economic growth, as the authors acknowledged. To address this issue, we will analyze the data using an alternative approach, without using the instrumental variable method. Details will be showed in the re-analysis section. 

Robustness check: 

 We successfully replicated the “false experiment” speciﬁcation that the authors attemped, in which future rainfall growth is used as an additional explanatory variable in the regression. We checked the coefﬁcient estimate for rainfall is near zero (coefﬁcient estimate -0.007, standard error 0.016, in regression 4 of table 2). The purpose of this robustness check is to test if rainfall is a valid instrument by including a "future" variable that is supposed to be uncorrelated with the treatment. 
 
 Additionally, we replicated dropping one country at a time for the IV-2SLS ﬁxed-effects results for the 25-death threshold. The purpose of this robustness check is to test if the relationship between economic growth and civil conflict remain stable if one country is an outlier (i.e. check if there is a country that has substentially more conflicts than others, which could exagerate the negative impact of economic shocks on civil conflict). We found that it's robust with coefﬁcients on lagged economic growth ranging from -1.743 to -1.078 and remaining signiﬁcant at 83.5 percent conﬁdence levels in all regressions. Although the magnitudes of our coefficients are smaller than those in the original paper, the results are still fairly robust. 


Re-analysis: Inversion Method

In the original paper, the authors use a weak IV and rely on cluster-robust standard errors to construct confidence intervals, based on asymptotic normality. We re-analyzed the data using the Fieller-Anderson-Rubin (FAR) method to construct confidence intervals instead because it's more robust to weak IV. Using FAR, we found that the confidence interval for the effect of lagged economic growth on civil conflict is much **wider** than the ones proposed by the authors. Controlling country characteristics, the graph below shows that the 95% confidene interval for the lagged economic growth range from -6.3 to 1.0, whereas the coefficients given by the authors range from -4.35 to -0.15 (regression 5, table 4). The great uncertainty in our estimates reflect the reality that weak IV tends to make estimates more unstable. Admittally though, the authors included two instruments and two treatments in their linear LV regression, but we only use the lagged economic growth and rainfall as instrument and treatment for our analysis, as we haven't learned how to handle situations where there are multiple intruments and treatments. 

Replication of the main results

There are two main results from the paper. The first result is that a 5 percent decline in annual per capita economic growth causally leads to a 12 percentage-point increase in the incidence of civil conflicts in Sub-saharan Africa. The second result is that this finding is robust regardless of the country's characteristics. In other words, economic condition determines the frequency and intensity of civil conflicts much more than a country's political structure (whether it's democratic), population size, demographics (whether it's religiously fragmented) or geology (whether it's mountainous). 

[^insert table 4 above] Table 4 contains the replication results for the first finding. The numbers without paratheses are point estimates based on our replication, whereas the numbers inside the paratheses contain the original results from the paper. The crucial estimate is the coefficient for lagged economic growth rate in the IV-2SLS regression (5). The original point estimate is -2.25, but our estimate is -1.324, meaning a 5 percent decline in annual per capita economic growth only leads to a 7 percentage-point increase in the incidence of civil conflicts, which is 40% less than the original estimate. However, the replication estimate has the same sign as the original estimate and is significant at nearly the 84 percent level. Similarly to the authors' finding, our IV estimates reveal that the negative impact of civil conflict are much stronger than the OLS estimates, suggesting that confounding in OLS hide the true effect.  

The reason why our replicated coefficients are weaker from the original paper is due to the version update in the Armed Conflict dataset, in which some conflicts are removed[^page 121, UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset's Version History and Known Errata, version 22.1] from version 1.0 to version 3.0. As we mentioned in previous sections, version 3.0 is the closest version we could find. This means that there are less conflicts contained in our dataset, which explains the disparity between the replicated and the original point estimates. 

Table 5 contains the replication results for the second finding. The purpose of this table is demostrate that country characterstics such as democracy, religious fractionalization and being mountainous have insignificant impacts on the relationship between economic growth and civil conflict. We successfully replicated this finding, as all the interaction terms are insignificant in both the authors' paper and our results. However, in constrast with the authors' finding, the coefficients for lagged economic growth are no longer significant after adding interaction terms. We spent a significant amount of time investigating why the disparity exists but we cannot figure out a reasonable answer.
